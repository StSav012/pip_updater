# `pip_updater`

Simple `pip`-based tools:
- `update-packages` tries to update all the packages in the environment,
- `orphaned-packages` shows the packages not required by other packages.

Furthermore, the package can provide the hierarchy of the installed packages
when the `list_packages_tree` function is called.

#### Installation

To install the package from GitHub using `pip`, issue

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/StSav012/pip_updater.git
```
